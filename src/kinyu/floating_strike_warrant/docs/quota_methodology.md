## 1. Usual LSMC structure (without quota)

In **Longstaff–Schwartz Monte Carlo (LSMC)**, you:

1. Simulate many paths of the underlying.
2. At each decision date (going backwards), regress the **continuation value** against a set of basis functions of the state (e.g., stock price (S_t), time (t)).
3. Use that regression to estimate whether to exercise or continue.

The regression is typically something like:
[
\widehat{C}(t, S_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \phi_1(S_t) + \beta_2 \phi_2(S_t) + \dots
]

## 2. Problem with quotas

With a **monthly 10% exercise cap**, the decision depends not only on the stock price but also on how much of the quota (q_t) remains.

So the value function is really:
[
V(t, S_t, q_t) \quad \text{not just } V(t, S_t).
]

If you ignored (q_t), you’d overstate the value (since the regression would think you can always exercise as much as you want).

---

## 3. Two approaches

### (A) **Multiple regressions (grid method)**

* Discretize quota (q_t) into bins (e.g., 0%, 2.5%, 5%, …, 10%).
* Run a *separate regression* for each bin.
* Downside: many regressions → noisy, computationally heavy.

### (B) **Single regression with quota-aware basis (my suggestion)**

* Run **one regression** for all paths, but **include (q_t) as an explanatory variable** in the regression basis.
* This way, the fitted continuation value is a function of both (S_t) and (q_t).

Formally:
[
\widehat{C}(t, S_t, q_t)
= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \phi_1(S_t) + \beta_2 \phi_2(S_t) + \beta_3 \psi_1(q_t) + \beta_4 \phi_1(S_t)\psi_1(q_t) + \dots
]

Where:

* (\phi)’s are functions of **underlying price/moneyness** (like (S/K, (S/K - 1)^+, (S/K - 1)^2)).
* (\psi)’s are functions of **remaining quota** (like (q_t, q_t^2, \sqrt{q_t})).
* Cross-terms capture the **interaction** between moneyness and quota availability.

---

## 4. Why this is powerful

* One regression is more **statistically efficient** than many small ones.
* By including quota features, the model “learns” that when (q_t) is low, continuation value is different than when (q_t) is high.
* Cross-terms like ((S/K - 1)^+ \cdot q_t) tell the model: *the value of being in-the-money depends on whether I still have quota left.*

---

## 5. Concrete example

Suppose we use basis functions:
[
\Phi(S,q) = {1,; S/K,; (S/K-1)^+,; q,; q^2,; (S/K-1)^+ \cdot q }.
]

Then the regression is:
[
\widehat{C}(t,S,q) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (S/K) + \beta_2 (S/K-1)^+ + \beta_3 q + \beta_4 q^2 + \beta_5 (S/K-1)^+ q.
]

Interpretation:

* (\beta_2): value of being in-the-money.
* (\beta_3,\beta_4): marginal value of having more quota left.
* (\beta_5): how “juicy” ITM payoff interacts with available quota.

This regression gives you a **smooth surface in (S,q)** instead of a collection of noisy bucketed estimates.

---

✅ **Summary**:
“Single regression with a quota-aware basis” means:

* Don’t split quota into bins and run multiple regressions.
* Run **one regression**, but enrich the basis functions to include (q_t) (remaining exercise allowance) and interaction terms with moneyness.
* This gives a continuation value estimate (\widehat{C}(t,S,q)) that naturally adjusts for how much quota is left.
